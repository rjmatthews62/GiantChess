# GiantChess
3D Giant chess with a small robot.

This is written in Unity 3D

It uses the free StarterAsset Thirdperson package from Unity, which you will need to import.

This is a 3D chess game.

Wander around a giant chessboard while a game takes places around you.

Controls: WASD or Arrow keys for movement, mouse to change view, space to jump.

Reload the page to restart.

This is intended to eventually become some sort of Assassin Chess, where your character has to sneak up on the opposing king. Currently you just wander around the board while trying not to get run over, but the worst that will happen is you get pushed through the board. It's OK, land back on the board. Ditto if you walk off the edge.

Right now it is not really a game, but it does look cool.

"P" will drop a random piece, "T" will take the piece you are looking at.
